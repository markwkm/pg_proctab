pg_proctab is a PostgreSQL extension that allows PostgreSQL users to access
parts of the Linux operating systems process table through the database.

This allows SQL queries to be constructed to access:

* System average load
* Memory usage
* Processor usage
* Memory, I/O and processor statistics per process


SQL statements can additionally be written to track usage per query.
